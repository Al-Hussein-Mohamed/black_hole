# 🕳️ Black Hole  

A simple yet strategic two-player number placement game built with **Flutter** and enriched with **smooth animations** for a more engaging experience.  

## 🎮 Game Rules

- **Scoring**:  
  - Look at the holes adjacent to the Black Hole.  
  - Sum Player 1’s numbers on those adjacent holes.  
  - Sum Player 2’s numbers on those adjacent holes.  
  - **The player with the smaller sum wins!**  

## ✨ Features  

- Interactive 2-player gameplay on the same device.  
- **Smooth animations** for moves, transitions, and interactions.  
- Simple rules but deep strategy.
